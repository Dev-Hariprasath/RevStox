# 📊 RevStox - Stock Data Analysis & Import System

RevStox is a Java-based console application designed to import, analyze, and manage stock market data (daily prices, analytics, and volumes) from CSV files using a PostgreSQL (or any JDBC-compatible) database backend. It provides basic CLI interfaces for users to interact with stock data analysis tools like VWAP, volatility, price changes, moving averages, and more.

---

## 🚀 Features

### 🔄 Data Import
- Import daily stock prices from CSV
- Import stock analytics like volatility and moving averages
- Batch insertions with JDBC for performance

### 📈 Price Analysis
- Daily price volatility
- Daily price change
- Price gaps
- 7-day and 30-day moving averages (via stored procedure)

### 📊 Volume Analysis
- VWAP (Volume Weighted Average Price)
- Daily turnover
- Volume trend analysis
- Deliverable volume percentage

### 📁 Stock Data Queries
- Historical data retrieval
- Filter data by date range
- Symbol-based stock queries
- Import and validate stock records

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

* Java 17+
* JDBC (PostgreSQL or MySQL)
* OpenCSV (for parsing `.csv` files)
* SQL stored procedures/functions
* Maven or Gradle (optional for dependency management)

---

## 📝 Prerequisites

1. **Java JDK 17+**
2. **PostgreSQL/MySQL** with required tables:

   * `daily_prices`
   * `stock_analytics`
   * Stored procedures: `generate_moving_avg`, `calc_volatility`
3. **OpenCSV Library**


## 📌 Sample CSV Structure

| trade\_date | symbol | ... | open | high | low  | ... | close | ... | volume  | turnover |
| ----------- | ------ | --- | ---- | ---- | ---- | --- | ----- | --- | ------- | -------- |
| 2023-08-01  | INFY   | ... | 1540 | 1565 | 1530 | ... | 1555  | ... | 1200000 | 18600000 |

Make sure CSVs have proper headers and match column order used in importer.
